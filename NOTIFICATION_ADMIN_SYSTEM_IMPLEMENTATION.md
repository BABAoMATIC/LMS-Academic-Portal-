# Notification System and Admin Dashboard Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the implementation of both Step 8 (Notification System for Real-Time Updates) and Step 9 (Admin Dashboard for Managing Assignments/Quizzes) in the Academic Portal. The system provides comprehensive real-time notifications and a powerful admin dashboard for managing all aspects of assignments and quizzes.

## Step 8: Notification System for Real-Time Updates

- **Assignment/Quiz Creation Notifications**: Students receive notifications when new assignments or quizzes are created
- **Feedback Notifications**: Students receive notifications when teachers provide feedback
- **Status Update Notifications**: Real-time status updates for assignments and quizzes

#### 2. WebSocket-Based Real-Time Communication
- **No Page Refresh Required**: All notifications are delivered in real-time without page refresh
- **Browser Notification Support**: Native browser notifications for important updates
- **Connection Status Monitoring**: Real-time connection status display
- **Automatic Reconnection**: Automatic reconnection handling for dropped connections

### Technical Implementation

#### Frontend Components

**NotificationService (`frontend/src/services/notificationService.ts`)**
```typescript
class NotificationService {
  // Comprehensive notification management
  private setupEventListeners(): void {
    // Assignment notifications
    this.socket.on('assignment_submitted', (data) => { /* Handle assignment submission */ });
    this.socket.on('assignment_graded', (data) => { /* Handle assignment grading */ });
    this.socket.on('assignment_created', (data) => { /* Handle assignment creation */ });
    
    // Quiz notifications
    this.socket.on('quiz_completed', (data) => { /* Handle quiz completion */ });
    this.socket.on('quiz_graded', (data) => { /* Handle quiz grading */ });
    this.socket.on('quiz_created', (data) => { /* Handle quiz creation */ });
    
    // Feedback notifications
    this.socket.on('feedback_provided', (data) => { /* Handle feedback provision */ });
    
    // Status update notifications
    this.socket.on('assignment_status_update', (data) => { /* Handle status updates */ });
    this.socket.on('quiz_status_update', (data) => { /* Handle status updates */ });
  }
}
```

#### Backend Implementation

**Enhanced WebSocket Events (`backend/simple_server.py`)**
```python
@socketio.on('assignment_created')
def handle_assignment_created(data):
    emit('assignment_created', data, broadcast=True)

@socketio.on('quiz_created')
def handle_quiz_created(data):
    emit('quiz_created', data, broadcast=True)

@socketio.on('feedback_provided')
def handle_feedback_provided(data):
    emit('feedback_provided', data, broadcast=True)
```

**Notification Data Structure**
```typescript
interface NotificationData {
  id: string;
  type: 'assignment_submitted' | 'quiz_completed' | 'assignment_graded' | 'quiz_graded' | 'assignment_created' | 'quiz_created' | 'feedback_provided';
  title: string;
  message: string;
  data: any;
  timestamp: Date;
  read: boolean;
  priority: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'urgent';
}
```

### Real-Time Update Flow

## Database Schema

### Enhanced Notification System
```sql
-- Notifications table (existing, enhanced)
CREATE TABLE notifications (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    user_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    message TEXT NOT NULL,
    type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,  -- 'assignment', 'quiz', 'feedback', 'general'
    read BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    timestamp DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    data JSON,  -- Additional notification data
    priority VARCHAR(10) DEFAULT 'medium'  -- 'urgent', 'high', 'medium', 'low'
);
```

### Admin Dashboard Analytics
```sql
-- Assignment statistics (computed)
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as submission_count,
    AVG(f.marks) as average_score,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN f.marks >= 60 THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as pass_rate
FROM submissions s
LEFT JOIN feedback f ON s.student_id = f.student_id AND s.assignment_id = f.assignment_id
WHERE s.assignment_id = ? AND s.is_latest = 1;

-- Quiz statistics (computed)
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) as attempt_count,
    AVG(percentage) as average_score,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN grade = 'Pass' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as pass_rate
FROM quiz_attempts 
WHERE quiz_id = ? AND is_latest = 1 AND status = 'completed';
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Real-Time Notification Flow

```typescript
// Student submits assignment
const formData = new FormData();
formData.append('file', selectedFile);
formData.append('assignment_id', assignmentId.toString());

const response = await fetch('/api/submissions/submit-comprehensive', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: formData
});

// Teacher receives real-time notification
notificationService.subscribeToAssignmentNotifications((notification) => {
  if (notification.type === 'assignment_submitted') {
    // Update dashboard, show notification, refresh submissions
    updateDashboard();
    showNotification(notification);
  }
});
```

### 2. Admin Dashboard Usage

```typescript
// Create new assignment
const assignmentData = {
  title: 'New Assignment',
  description: 'Assignment description',
  deadline: '2024-01-15',
  module_name: 'Module 1'
};

const response = await fetch('/api/assignments', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify(assignmentData)
});

// Dashboard automatically updates with new assignment
// Students receive real-time notification
```

### 3. Performance Analytics

```typescript
// Get assignment statistics
const response = await fetch('/api/admin/assignments/123/stats');
const stats = await response.json();

// Display in dashboard
console.log(`Submissions: ${stats.submission_count}`);
console.log(`Average Score: ${stats.average_score}%`);
console.log(`Pass Rate: ${stats.pass_rate}%`);
```
